👨‍💻 About the Author
Hi, I'm Jimmie. I build at the intersection of curiosity and automation.

Without a formal degree, my journey has been defined by self-directed learning and a hands-on approach to AI. This repository is a testament to how modern technology can bridge the gap between an idea and a finished product.

The Goal To showcase how AI can be used responsibly to solve real-world problems and democratize access to powerful automation.

🛠️ The Method Built through relentless experimentation, iterative testing, and a "learn-by-doing" philosophy.
